                <br>
                  <p>We went into this project with the theory that factors of socioeconomic status 
                    could be linked to crimes that were committed with weather conditions acting 
                    as a contributing factor into these events. The state of Ohio, specifically 
                    Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati, wwere to be our target areas and 
                    2010 to 2017 would be our timeframe. .</p>

                  <p>We initially tried to gather weather information for the corresponding years
                    but annual weather data does not provide any true granularity and would not be a 
                    good frame of reference to our crime and census data.  As a result we abandoned 
                    this option and stayed with the FBI and Census data. </p>

              <h2 class="title" align="center">API Challenges</h2>
              <br>
                <p>The first step that we took to clean the datasets involved eliminating variables 
                  were not relevant to the question we posed.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Given the API documentation, much of this could be done before pulling the data, as 
                  the FBI and Census data is fairly complete to begin with. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  We then used python code in a Jupyter notebook to pull in the data from both the APIs 
                  and manipulate what was retrieved. We sought out assistance from both our instructor 
                  and TA due to the difficulty that we faced trying to make our loop code work. After 
                  some difficulties we were able to make the data work and got all of the years and states
                  we wanted to include in the dataset.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  We finally did some data computations with the Census data and computed the poverty rate, 
                  unemployment rate, and educational attainment rates to include in the database, as some 
                  people may want raw numbers, but rates provide better data for comparison when referring 
                  to unequal (state) population sizes.

                  <h2 class="title" align="center">SQL/Mongo Challenges</h2>
                  <br>
                  <p>First, an ERD diagram was made to show the relationship between the Census education and housing variables
                    and the FBI crime variables using <a href="https://app.quickdatatbasediagrams.com/#/"> 
                    https://app.quickdatatbasediagrams.com/#/</a> to create our ERD diagram.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                      Our next step was to transfer our final outputs into a database. We created a SQL and a Mongo database.
                      Both databases were formatted with tables and columns from the final Pandas dataframes that were converted
                      into CSV files. The CSV files were imported into PostgreSQL and MongoDB Compass.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      After some initial challenges, ensuring the variables were in the proper format for the SQL database and 
                      that the code was running in the GitBash instead of Mongo command prompt for Mongo, both databases were uploaded
                      relatively seamlessly.
